# Embrace-the-Chaos
A repo to practice branching and merging across multiple people (thus the chaos) during our class workshop.

## Instructions

For this workshop, follow the below steps. Write your answers to any questions in this `Readme.md` file; no other files will be created or required.

1. Setup this repo locaclly so you can contribute to it. Which Git command(s) do I need?

2. Create your own branch.

3. Write anything you want in your favorite peice of GitHub Markdown below (e.g. images, tables, emoji, etc.)

4. Add, commit and push your Readme file to your branch.

5. Create a pull request to merge your branch to master. Give your pr a **label**.

6. Work with Emily to get your pr merged. You may start seeing merge conflicts which is ok. What are ways we can handle this so that each student's answer to Q3 remains intact?

7. Once your pr is merged, pull down the latest changes. Makes sure all changes from **master** are merged into your branch. Which Git command do I need for this?

## Review Questions

1. What is a merge conflict and why does it happen?

2. What are the 2 sets of Git commands we've learned to setup a repo for local development? When is it best to use each?

3. Which Git command(s) are needed to create a new branch?

4. How do pull requests contribute to the modern software engineering culture?

5. What does the `.gitignore` file do?

## Bonus questions

1. What are ways I can modify the `git add` command to add a specific file? How would I add all changed files in a specific folder?

2. How would I undo a `git add` command on a specific file?

3. What is GitHub Markdown? What are 3 examples of it used in this `Readme.md` file?

4. Look up the `git log` command. What does it do and what cool combos of arguments did you find online for it?
